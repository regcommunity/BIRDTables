# BIRDTables
The BIRD logical data model, forward engineered into under 20 tables

BIRD Tables provides the familiarity of a concise datamodel, using the columns and allowed values that will make up tommorows harmonised European regulations , backed by the explicit  detail of the BIRD Logical Datamodel.

Forward engineering in BIRDTables is done using Eclipse Edapt ( https://eclipse.dev/edapt/ ) on an Ecore representation of the BIRD LDM which is generated by the FreeBIRD github project ( https://github.com/regcommunity/FreeBIRD ) from the official artefacts of BIRD published on the ECB BIRD website at https://bird.ecb.europa.eu/

The use of Edapt should  allow efficient test data that is  created in the LDM with tool support to be automatically migrated to be test data in the concise input layer at the click of a button.
